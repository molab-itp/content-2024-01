# [content-2024-01 Mobile App Development Lab](https://github.com/molab-itp/content-2024-01)

One of the most transformative consumer products in history, the iPhone remains
the standard bearer for great design and user experience. With the latest
versions of iOS and iPhone, Apple puts depth sensing and augmented reality in
our pockets. How do we take advantage of this incredible platform to produce our
own compelling experiences?

This course will be a hands-on workshop where we explore the world beyond
generic apps and push the boundaries of what's possible on iOS hardware. Each
week, you'll be asked to complete a programming exercise meant to foster your
understanding of iOS application development. We'll leverage existing open source
libraries to quickly build out your app with features such as
real time communication and cloud storage.

We aim to create distributed instruments for computed expression.

Full-time access to an iOS device and a Mac laptop computer
running the latest operating system and development tools are required.

Prereq:
Some programming experience (such as ICM) and willingness to learn Apple's Swift programming language.
